Notes

2018/07/26: Converting all of the files to python 3. Note that python 3 has an
incomplete crypto library, so it isn't clear that it can do much more than
sign and hash files. Will convert all files to python 3 syntax and libraries,
but some may not be able to run.

decryptFile.py: converted to 3, but can't be tested since encryptFile.py 
won't run.
decryptText.py: converted to 3, but can't be tested since encryptText.py won't run
encryptText.py: converted to 3, but won't run because RSA key format is not
    supported
encryptFile.py: converted to 3, but won't run because RSA key format is not
    supported
findZeroHash.py: converted to 3, runs
genKey.py: converted to 3, runs; might want to change from RSA if some other
    form of key is supported in python 3
hashText.py: converted to 3, runs
hashFile.py: converted to 3, runs
hashDict.py: converted to 3, runs
signFile.py: Converted to 3, but RSA key is not supported
verifyFile.py: Converted to 3, but RSA key is not supported
verifyText.py: Converted to 3, but RSA key is not supported
